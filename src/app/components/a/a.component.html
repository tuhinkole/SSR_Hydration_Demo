    <p>
      This is a demo of Angular's Transfer State feature, which allows you to transfer data from the server to the client side.
      The data is fetched from a public API and displayed in an accordion format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data is fetched only once on the server side, and then transferred to the client side, reducing the need for additional HTTP requests.
